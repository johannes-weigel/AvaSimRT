# AvaSimRT

This project is developed in the context of a seminar at [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), Group of [Telecommunication Networks](https://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/).

It combines [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org) with [Sionna RT](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/rt/index.html) to perform preparatory simulations for measuring movement in (snow) avalanches using UWB ranging techniques.

## Requirements

The project has been developed and tested with **Python 3.11.7**.
Other Python versions may work, but compatibility is not guaranteed and has not been systematically tested.

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required dependencies.

```bash
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
